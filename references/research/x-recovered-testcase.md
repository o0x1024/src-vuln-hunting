- Find a Business Logic Bug:
  1. Register a new account (note the username)

  • Internal panels → hidden features
  • Third-party integrations → security gaps
- XSS tip: don't stop at alert(1). Real XSS impact comes from session takeover, CSRF token theft, account actions via JS, DOM persistence (stored in localStorage). If it's not exploitable, it's not a bug.
